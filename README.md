# FYS-STK-4155-Project1-Regression

This project is an overview and practicum of regression methods: ordinary least squares, ridge and lasso. We test these methods on the Franke function and real topography data.

The project report and an appendix for training error results are found in the "report" folder, and the code used to generate the results and figures is in the "code" folder. The code is divided into four notebooks: one for OLS on Franke function, one for ridge on Franke function, one for lasso on Franke function, and one for the implementation of the 3 regression methods on real data.
